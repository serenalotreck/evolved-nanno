# evolved-nanno
Code to analyze genomic variation bewteen evolved strains of *Nannochloropsis salina*

## Variant calling
All scripts and samplesheets needed to run the variant calling pipeline are found in [`evolved-nanno/sarek`](https://github.com/serenalotreck/evolved-nanno/tree/main/sarek).

## Candidate gene identification
All candidate gene identification was performed in the notebook [`evolved-nanno/notebooks/variant_exploration.ipynb`](https://github.com/serenalotreck/evolved-nanno/blob/main/notebooks/variant_exploration.ipynb)

## Data availability
The genome, genome annotation, and WGS files used for these analyses can be found at TODO
